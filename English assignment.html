Let start on a good page,on this paragraph I will be talking about my 2023"JANUARYY".This pictures on the left symbolises my good start on the year 2023,I started my 2023 with my precious family and that made me happy because that showed me that we will be always there for each other.The main goal I set on january was to make the woman who's in the center happy,that woman is my mother.<big><b><font color="gray">"Few days later"</font></b></big> my external cambridge results were to be released that week and fear came to me even though I knew very well what I wrote and what I might be expecting,lucky GOD was with me.I passed very well and my mom was over the moon meaning she was very happy compared to me.After all this happy moment the real struggle had to begin where I started to search for international fully funded scholarships because my main dream was to pursuit my studies overseas and do computer science/BCA as I new that maybe if I excel in this courses I might be a better person in the future who deals with networking and making games that will attract big companies like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gta+5+gameplay&oq=&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgBECMYJxjqAjIJCAAQIxgnGOoCMgkIARAjGCcY6gIyCQgCECMYJxjqAjIJCAMQIxgnGOoCMgkIBBAjGCcY6gIyCQgFECMYJxjqAjIJCAYQIxgnGOoCMgkIBxAjGCcY6gLSAQo1NDIzMjJqMGo3qAIIsAIB&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" title="Goes to google"><font color="black">ROCKSTAR</font></a> to hire me.CLICK THE BLACK ROCKSTAR TO SEE AN EXAMPLE OF A ROCKSTAR GAME

They said we will never make it
We were going to far
But we went the distance you and I
And Here we are
Here we are
I hope you still have patience.
To try and reach for the stars
We still trying to make it to thefor the sky carry on carry on

Thando lwethu baby is amazing sometimes don't deserve it
Noma bathi thina solahleka...

See love lives
And Love dies
Love forgives
And love tries
Love comes
And Love goes
And I love all of this love shown
Cos bengazi kungaba soh
Mangiya ekasi sewu actor soh
My paint brush
My heartfelt song
The paint dries
Mara yi art lento
See I talk and you speak
Then I walk and you scream
I found you I found love
You find me you find us

They said we will never make it
We were going to far
But we went the distance you and I
And here we are, here we are
I hope you still have patience
To try and reach for the stars
We still trying to make it to the sky carry on, carry on

Thando lwethu baby is amazing
We sometimes don't deserve it
Noma bathi thina solahleka
Love is navigating and we're almost home

Ndicela uhlalele phansi love
Am I everything that you want
And I know that this once was
But is that still who we are
Cos I, I want you to love me
As part of who I am and not just because
And you know that I go through you things
But deepdown inside I know you never forgot that

They said we will never make it
We were going to far
But we went the distance you and I
And here we are, here we are
I hope you still have patience
To try and reach for the stars
We still trying to make it to the sky carry on, carry on

Thando lwethu baby is amazing
We sometimes don't deserve it
Noma bathi thina solahleka
Love is navigating and we're almost home

Angikaze ngithande umuntu ngalendlela
Ngawe baby mina ngiyaziqhenya
Uthando lwakho baby olwangempela
Angifuni omunye umuntu ngifuna wena

Thando lwethu baby is amazing
We sometimes don't deserve it
Noma bathi thina solahleka
Love is navigating and we're almost home

April is the month where I was brought to life and that why this month is very significant to me and I share this birthday month with my mom, most people don't believe this coincidence.Last year during this month I didn't do that much fun but I had same wonderful moment with my friend who's now a brother to me because we have been friends for 13 years.I know that you may be asking yourself that is that all,unfortunate that is not all the moment I didn't mention are too personal.

I can't hide myself
I don't expect you to understand
I just hope I can explain
What it's like to be a man
It's a lonely road
And they don't care 'bout what you know
It's not 'bout how you feel
But what you provide inside that home

Yeah, I know this life can really beat you down, uh
You wanna scream but you won't make a sound, uh
Got so much weight that you've been holdin'
But won't show any emotion, as a man, that goes unspoken
That we can't cry when life gets hard
Unconditional love for women, children and dogs
We know that we just have to play our parts
And don't nobody give a damn about our broken hearts, yeah
As a man, we gotta pave our way
Our only function is to work and slave
There's no respect for you if you ain't paid
You're disregarded as a human and you can't complain
And if you ever make it up and actually reach that place
And find a woman that you love and give her your last name
You'll feel the things that you provide is only why she stays
And when you try to explain, you'll say

I can't hide myself
I don't expect you to understand
I just hope I can explain
What it's like to be a man (what it's like to be a man)
It's a lonely road (it's a lonely road)
And they don't care 'bout what you know (care 'bout what you know)
It's not 'bout how you feel
But what you provide inside that home

Don't give up, keep fightin'
As a man, our son is our horizon
And our fathers' actions play a role and we end up like him
So they can't let us see them hurt
'Cause we'll embody what we do and start a generational curse
No wonder most men are so depressed
All the things that they can't express
They go to war, get thrown on the shelf
Then go back to war with they mental health
Then grab that bottle and ask for help
Try to pull themselves out of hell
Then fall back down and then realize
That they gon' have to do it themselves
It's the circle of life, as a man, you provide
They don't know what you're worth 'til the day that you die
And that's when they start cryin'
Then move on to a man to confide in
That's why we feel

We can't hide ourselves
We don't expect you to understand
We just hope we can explain
What it's like to be a man (what it's like to be a man)
It's a lonely road (it's a lonely road)
And you don't care 'bout what we know (care 'bout what we know)
It's not 'bout how we feel
But what we provide inside that home (inside that home)
That home
It's not 'bout how we feel
But what we provide inside that home (inside that home)
